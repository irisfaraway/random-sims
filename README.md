# random-sims

Sometimes I want to make a new family in The Sims 2 without having to think much about the composition.

This extremely basic Sinatra site generates random potential families for The Sims.

You will still have to add the families yourself, but at least you now have a plan (or at least some inspiration) for what and who to make.

## To do:

- Refactor massive hell file
- Generate multiple families at once
- Add other prompts, like additional challenges or potential storylines
- Random names (this can only end well)
